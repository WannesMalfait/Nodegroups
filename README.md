# Nodegroups
A collection of free to use node groups, created in my videos or elsewhere

### Short descriptions

- `RayMarching.blend` A collection of node groups related to ray marching, includes some SDF's as well.
- `catenary_demo.blend` A demo file containing a node group to create a [catenary curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) (like the shape formed by a hanging chain) between two points. 
- `euler_integration.blend` Demo of [forward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) using simulation nodes, to solve the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = y, y(0) = 1$ numerically (analytic solution is $y = e^x$). It also contains a node group for the [Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods).
- `lorenz_system.blend` Similar to `euler_integration.blend`, but applied to the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).
- `paint_strokes.blend` Effect to make an image look "painterly" by instancing planes.
