# Nodegroups
A collection of free to use nodegroups, created in my videos or elsewhere

### Short descriptions

- `RayMarching.blend` A collection of nodegroups related to ray marching, includes some SDF's as well.
- `catenary_demo.blend` A demo file containing a node group to create a catenary curve (like the shape formed by a hanging chain) between two points. 
- `euler_integration.blend` Demo of forward Euler method using simulation nodes, to solve the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = y, y(0) = 1$ numerically (analytic solution is $y = e^x$. It also contains a node group for the Runge-Kutta method.
- `lorenz_system.blend` Similar to `euler_integration.blend` , but applied to the Lorenz system of differential equations.
- `paint_strokes.blend` Effect to make an image look "painterly" by instancing planes.
